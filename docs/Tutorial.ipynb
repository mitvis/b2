    "# Midas Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello! Please follow the tutorial to learn the basics of Midas. Be sure to play around until you are comfortable. You will have about 20 minutes. Should you have any questions, please feel free to ask Yifan, who will be present during the entire session.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Midas is a Jupyter notebook library/extension that aids data exploration by providing relevant static  visualizations. The key of Midas is that **the operations you perform in the interactive visualization space is also reflected in code space**---you will see what this means if you run the code cells below!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataframe Operations\n",
    "Midas is a special dataframe with syntax using that of the [data science module](http://data8.org/datascience/) from Data 8. Thw following are common operations that might be useful for querying:\n",
    "\n",
    "* SELECT: `df.select(['col_name', 'more_col_name'])` --- Note that columns are referenced as strings.\n",
    "* WHERER: `df.where('col_name', predicate)` -- the predicates are using lambda functions provided in the [`are`](http://data8.org/datascience/predicates.html) library, such as `are.above(8)` (as opposed to function overloading as seen in pandas, like `df[df['a']>8]`. If you wish to compare two columns, then you can use `.where('col1', preidcate, 'col2')`, such as `marbles.where(\"Price\", are.above, \"Amount\")`.\n",
    "* GROUP BY: `df.group('col_name', agg_fun)`, the default aggregation for a `group` is count, but you can also supple the aggregation by using existing aggregation functions such as Python's built in `sum`, `min`, `max` (or any of the `numpy` aggregation methods that work on arrays). The groupby operation is applied to all the columns that are not being grouped by on.\n",
    "* Apply general methods: `df.apply(map_fun, new_column_name)` -- for instance, if you want to derive a new column that was the original column plus 1, with the new column called \"incremented\", the function you can call is `df.apply(lambda x: x + 1, 'incremented')`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are useful for data modification:\n",
    "* `append_column(label, values)` appends a new column, note that values must be created via `make_array` (so that it's numpy compliant) \n",
    "* `append(array_of_new_values)` appends a new row\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you can also access the columns as numpy arrays by using `df['col_name']`, which can be handy to use methods like `np.average(df['col_name'])`."

In the cases where the selections are no longer relevant, such as when the relevant column is deleted, the charts will be deleted, but the cells will remain.  You can of course create a new dataframe from which to derive charts from, in order to preserve the old ones.  Note that you cannot update derived dataframes. So in our tutorial, only `disasters` can be updated."
